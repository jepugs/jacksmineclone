* Mob spawning
- mobs spawn in the center of a tile
- spiders cannot spawn if any adjacent tile contains a block
- mobs cannot spawn on transparent blocks except upper slabs
- algorithm: pick a place to spawn a mob, then try to find a location

** slabs
- MC mobs can spawn on top/double slabs but not on bottom slabs. This is
  different from most transparent block

* Transparency

** slabs
- single slabs are transparent in bedrock. In java, they block light, but
  otherwise act like transparent blocks. (I'm leaning toward bedrock behavior on
  this one).
- upper slabs can support redstone
